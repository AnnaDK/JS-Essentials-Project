# Starter Maths Game

This maths game is used to teach the basics of JavaScript and the DOM.

## REQUIRED CHALLENGE

* Get the other two games working
* Improve the styling
* Provide better feedback to the user - we don't want to use `alert()`.
* Limit the answer history `div` to the previous 20 answers

## BONUS CHALLENGES

* Add a division game that requires integers as answers
* Add a timer to the project
* Add difficulty levels - Easy, Normal, Difficult - that affect the complexity of the questions.
* Add a high-score chart for people who get the most answers right in the time available (research using local storage)
