# Starter Maths Game

This maths game is used to teach the basics of JavaScript and the DOM. [Live version.](https://lechien73.github.io/mathsgame-review/)

## REQUIRED:

* Get the other two games working
* Improve the styling
* Provide better feedback to the user - we don't want to use `alert()`
* Limit the answer history `div` to the previous 20 answers

## BONUS:

* Add a division game that requires integers as answers
* Add difficulty levels - Easy, Normal, Difficult - that affect the complexity of the questions

## OPTIONAL:
* Add a countdown timer to the game
* Add a high-score chart for people who get the most answers right in the time available (research using local storage)
